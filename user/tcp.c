/**
 * @file tcp.c
 *
 * @brief TCP server routines for the ESP8266.
 * 
 * Abstract the espconn interface and manage multiply connection.
 * 
 * Notes:
 *  - From glancing at the AT code, I have concluded that the member `reverse`
 *    in `struct espconn`, is there for the user. This has proven to be almost
 *    true, actually the only time it fails, it fails in a way that is really 
 *    neat, but I dare not abuse.
 *  - I have no idea how many connections are possible.
 *  - It seems espconn works on top of lwip, and that it might be better to talk 
 *    to lwip itself.
