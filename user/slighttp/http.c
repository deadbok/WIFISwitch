/** @file http.c
 *
 * @brief Simple HTTP server for the ESP8266.
 * 
 * Simple HTTP server, that only supports the most basic functionality, and is
 * small.
 * 
 * To keep memory use small, the data passed to the server, from the network, is 
 * expected to stay until the server is done with them. Instead of making a copy
 * of the data from the network, the server inserts `\0` characters directly into
 * the data. The server then point to the values directly in the network data.
 * 
 * What works:
 * - GET requests.
 * - HEAD requests.
 * - POST requests.
 * - CRLF, LF, and space tolerance (never tested except for space).
 * - File system access.
 * 
 * The server can have different document roots for pages loaded from the file
 * system, but the error pages like `404.html` are always loaded from the root.
 * 
 * **This server is not compliant with HTTP, to save space, stuff has been
 * omitted. It has been built to be small, not fast, and probably breaks in 100
 * places.** 
 * 
 * Missing functionality:
 * - Does not understand any header fields.
 * - 400 errors are not send in all situations where they should be.
 * - Persistent connections. The server closes every connection when the 
 *   response has been sent.
 * - Chunked transfers.
 * 
 * Things that needs to be dealt with, from the specs:
 * - Space between start line, and header (RFC7230.txt Line 1095).
