/**
 * @mainpage WIFISwitch source docs.
 * 
 * Introduction.
 * =============
 * 
 * Source level documentation for a network controlled mains switch, using the
 * ESP8266 WIFI interface and micro controller.
 * 
 *  
 * Architecture.
 * =============
 * 
 * The ESP8266 SDK is a strange beast, it seems a mix of procedural and event
 * driven. The WIFI functions do not use call backs, while the TCP functions
 * do. A little consistency would be nice here, a call back when the connection
 * is lost? But no. Oh and there are bugs, at least that's how I see them, like
 * the TCP disconnect call back, getting passed a mostly unusable parameter.
 * 
 * After trying to force a procedural scheme on it all, and chasing the same
 * shortcoming into a corner, I finally realised that, I was working against
 * the SDK.
 * The SDK seems to run in the same single task, as the user code. This has
 * the implication, that if you eat up all cycles, nothing gets done in the
 * SDK. If you do this for to long, the watch dog timer will kick in, and
 * reset the chip. You have to leave your functions, for the SDK to take over
 * processing. In my case, I would parse a HTTP request, and assemble the
 * response in one large go, then leave the control to the CPU. This sorta
 * worked. But what happens if the response is larger than the SDK TCP buffer,
 * or a new request is received before the sending is done, and it all ends
 * up with one more response to send. Stuff will get lost, and things will not
 * behave as expected.
 *   
 * I ended up dreaming about my Delphi days (something that I almost never do),
 * and that call, that you could make to get the system to do some processing,
 * while you where in a long chunk of code; But in the SDK there is none.
 * Instead no user code may run for more than 10ms, the docs says. To
 * accomplish this, a state machine seems a good solution. The state machine
 * is triggered at regular intervals using the one timer available. The TCP
 * request is still handled in the receive call back, but the sending code
 * is running in the state machine, which allows me to split the response
 * into chunks, and give back control to the SDK between sending each one.
